        <tr>
            <td>On March 2nd, 1801, President John Addams went through the process of submitting 42 judicial appointments to the Senate for a list of individuals to be justices of the
                 peace in the District of Columbia. A man named William Marbury was one of the forty-two names submitted but his name was unfortunately misspelled “Marberry” in the Senate Executive Journal.
                  on March 3rd, 1801 the following day which was also John Addams's last day in office, Marbury’s submission was confirmed along with the other forty-two appointments submitted. The very next day, 
                  Thomas Jefferson took office in the white house and as the verification of the forty-two submissions 
                came to fruition James Madison, the secretary of state did not deliver four commissions as there were present inconsistancies and because of this, Jefferson ordered the commissions be withheld.

        <tr>
            <td> On January 28th, 1803, William Marbury, Robert Townsend Hooe, and Dennis Ramsay petitioned The Senate to deliver them a certified copy of their official 
                nominations to be justices of the peace for the counties of Washington and Alexandria in Columbia. Three days later on the 31st, The Senate reviewed their petition
                 addressing the incidents that occurred on March 2nd and March 3rd bringing to question the commission's legitimacy in government as the president had already placed
                  the submissions on hold. Because of the president’s previous decision and The Senate’s discussion, they decided to deny Marbury’s petitions by a vote of 13 to 15. 
                  After hearing of The Senate’s decision, Marbury pressed charges upon James Madison with the intention of getting his commission processed. On February 24th, 1803, 
                  Marbury won against Madison in The Supreme Court as his constitutional rights were deemed violated. Madison’s act of withholding an already signed and sealed 
                  presidential document stopping Marbury from obtaining the privileges provided as a justice of the peace was an act of ignorance. William Marbury’s offensive 
                  against Secretary of State James Madison led to the establishment of Judicial Review, a process that inquires The Supreme Court to dictate whether or not a branch 
                  of government is violating rights provided under The United States Constitution.

        <tr>
            <td>After the court case of Marbury v Madison, we have been left with the lesson learned and adapted into our government represented by the Supreme Court's
                 frame for Judicial Review keeping our government in check. As the years go by and our economy and system progress to optimality, Judicial Review still, 
                 two hundred and twenty-four years later, continues to affect the laws created and the laws revoked in our government system and is used as a means of 
                 organizing what is and what isn't fair in today's society. This process of constitutional review protects the people from government abuse of rights and
                  has effectively ensured the freedom of citizens since its creation in 1803. An example of Judicial review in a more modern light would be the case of 
                  Ladue v. Gilleo, 1994. Margaret Gilleo owned a nice and comfortable American home in the city of Ladue, Missouri. In the front yard of her own home, 
                  Gilleo displayed a sign that read “Say No to War in the Persian Gulf, Call Congress Now”. The city of Ladue had an enforced rule against yard signs 
                  and lawfully ordered Gilleo to take down her sign. Margaret sued the city of Ladue for violating her 1st amendment rights. Long story short the lower 
                  courts sided with Gilleo and when Ladue appealed to the Supreme Court, they affirmed the decision of the lower courts as they had successfully justified Gilleo’s 
                  argument of constitutionality and allowed her to keep her sign. This is a perfect example of the Marbury v. Madison’s Judicial Review working in a more modern light.
                   Its impressive to see a court case from over 200 years ago effecting events happening everyday.
