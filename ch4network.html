            <li>Star Network- </li>
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection is a protocal that dictates that each message be broadcast to all machines on a network, detecting if transmissions 
                    clash. if two machines clash, both machines will pause then discontinue transmitting.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance is a protocal designed to avoid transmission clashes between wireless machines by giving 
                    advantage to devices that have already been waiting for an opportunity to transmit.

            </ul>
            <li>Bridge</li>
            <ul>
                <li>similar to a repeater but more complex, a bridge connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all messages across yhe connection.
                     instead, it looks at the destination address that accompanies each message and forwards a message across the connection 
                     only when that message is destined for a computer on the other side.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Switch</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a switch is essentially a bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two. 
                    a switch produces a network consisting of several buses extending from the switch like spokes on a wheel.
                </li>

            <li>Router</li>

                <li>routers are special purpose computer used for handling connection between networks to form an internet</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Gateway</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a gateway is the "point" at which one network is link to an internet because it serves as a passagway between the network and the outside world</li>

            <ul>
                <li>P2P is a client/server model that involves processes that provide service to and recieve service from each other. P2P usually involves processes that execute on a temporary basis.
                     P2P is essentially a system by which two processes communicate over a network.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Distributed System</li>
            <ul>
                <li>distributed systems consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cloud Computing</li>
            <ul>
                <li>cloud computing is when huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients if as needed</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Tier 1</li>
            <ul>
                <li>at the top of the ISP hierarchy are the few tier 1 ISPs consisting of very high speed, high capacity international WANs. these networks are the backbone of the internet and usually operated by large companies.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tier 2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>connecting to the tier 1 ISPs are the tier 2 ISPs that tend to be more regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities (the distinction between tier 1 and tier 2 ISPs is often a matter of opinion). tier 2 ISPs are usually operated by companies in the communications business.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Tier 3</li>
            <ul>
                <li>tier 1 and tier 2 ISPs are essentially networks of routers that collectively provide the internet's communication infrastructure. the many possible
                     pathways between routers gives this core of the internet redundancy, meaning that most or all of the internet remains connected even when very important 
                     tier 1 routers fail. access to this core is usually provided by an intermediary called an access or a tier 3 ISP.

                     these would require additional activity from either the browser or the webserver. such activities are called client side activities if they are
